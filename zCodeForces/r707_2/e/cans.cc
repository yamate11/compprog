/*
  Skelton for Interactive Problems

  (1) Edit the following member functions in JudgeRem class 
      They are for adjusting the interface.
      - constructor
      - ask()   (or ask_q() and ask_a())
      - answer()
  (2) Write function game().  This is for writing your algorithm.
  (3) For hand debugging, compile and run.
  (4) For automated testing, do the following
  (4.1) Set the value of macro JUDGE_LOC to 1.
  (4.2) Edit JudgeLoc struct

  Testing
    (*) ./cans
       This is the true program.  You can manually input data into its
       stdin.
    (**) ./cans judge < din.txt
       One-shot testing.  The format of din.txt is not defined by the
       writer of the question.  You can freely set the spec for the input
       file so that JudgeLoc() can read the input.
    (***) cmpNaive -i -e -p './cans judge'
       cmpNaive testing.  Runs multiple times against test files
       generated by `gen' script.  A test run is regarded as a success
       if its exit code is zero.
